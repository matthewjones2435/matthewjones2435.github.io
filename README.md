### Matthew Jones   

The more noise the better, and I love to make noise, I am truly passionate about all things sound.  Whether it is working with  music, sound design, physical, or virtual sound I love to shape, bend, distort, stretch, and manipulate sound into the uncanny.  My passion for all things noise has also lead me into my interest in programming and software development, where I hope to build upon my experience to develop the tools to be used by future generations of musicians and sound artists alike.  


Currently residing in Albuquerque, New Mexico I am attending Java and Android development Deepdive coding bootcamp, where I hope to gain experience and useful skill in programming and software development.  I hope to grow from the knowledge gained through this experience and build upon the skills learned so that I may establish my self in the continually growing and evolving tech industry.  As part of the coding program I aim to develop and android appliacation that will use realtime twitter data to generate beats and/or melodic "riffs" to serve as a starting point or creative inspiration for musicians to create larger musical pieces with.
